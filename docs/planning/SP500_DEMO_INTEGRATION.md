# S&P 500 Demo Lab Integration Guide

## Overview

The S&P 500 Demo Lab represents a comprehensive integration of template matching and account classification within our existing goal-first trading education framework. This system bridges the gap between theoretical learning and practical market experience using authentic 2025 S&P 500 data.

## Integration Points

- **Market Education**: Real market scenarios with authentic events and price movements
- **Screening Parameters**: Profile-based recommendations for market approach
- **Stock Selection**: Demonstrated through S&P 500 historical performance analysis

### 2. Component Architecture Integration

#### Core Components
- **`SP500DemoPage.tsx`**: Main learning interface with three-step progressive disclosure

## Account Classification System

### Template Matching Algorithm

The system uses a weighted scoring approach:

```javascript
const weights = {
  accountSize: 0.2,      // Logarithmic scale for better matching
  riskTolerance: 0.25,   // Direct and adjacent level matching
  experience: 0.2,       // Progressive skill level assessment
  primaryGoal: 0.25,     // Goal alignment with compatibility matrix
  timeHorizon: 0.1       // Investment time frame matching
};
```
