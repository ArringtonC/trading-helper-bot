## SECTION II: GOAL IDENTIFICATION & PERSONALIZATION SYSTEM

### Trading Goal Research Analysis

**Five Primary Goal Categories (Validated):**

1. **Income Generation (32% of new traders)**
   - **Low payout ratio (<60%) and respectable dividend yield (2.5-8%)**
   - **Current ratio ≥2.0** as financial health indicator
   - **5+ years of steady dividend growth** required
   - Target sectors: Utilities, REITs, Consumer Staples

2. **Growth Seeking (28% of new traders)**
   - **Market cap ≤$1.0B** for maximum growth potential
   - **EPS growth in top 20%** of market performance
   - **PEG ratio ≤2.0** for reasonable valuation
   - **Small-cap stocks 15-20% more profitable** than large-cap

3. **Capital Preservation (25% of new traders)**
   - **Beta ≤1.0** for defensive characteristics
   - **Blue-chip stocks with market leadership**
   - **Defensive sectors:** Healthcare, utilities, consumer staples
   - **Consistent earnings growth over 5+ years**

4. **Learning/Practice (10% of new traders)**
   - **Paper trading environments** with no real money risk
   - **Educational stock picks** with mistake-friendly characteristics
   - **Simulated environments** for skill development

5. **Active Trading (5% of new traders)**
   - **$25,000 minimum equity required** (Pattern Day Trading Rule)
   - **High volatility plays** with appropriate risk warnings
   - **Day trading: high-risk strategy with high chance of losses**

### Psychological Bias Detection

**Research-Identified Biases:**
- **Projection Bias**: Projecting current emotions onto future market conditions
- **Overconfidence Bias**: Overestimating abilities, ignoring stop-losses  
- **Loss Aversion**: Feeling losses more deeply than gains

**Goal Conflict Resolution:**
- **Safety + Quick Profits = Contradictory** (educate on risk/return relationship)
- **30% monthly returns with $500 capital** = unrealistic (require education)
- **10% return in 6 months** = realistic for some, unrealistic for others (context-dependent)

### Template-Based Matching System

**AI Algorithm Performance:**
- **TS-Deep-LtM algorithm: 30% higher annualized returns** than CSI300 index
- **Genetic algorithms: up to 28.41% returns** in 1-month backtesting
- **I Know First algorithm: 9 out of 10 correct predictions** using genetic approaches
- **Holly AI processes 70+ investment algorithms daily** for optimal matching

**Deep Matching Components:**
```javascript
// Technical Implementation Requirements
const MATCHING_ALGORITHMS = {
  DEEP_LEARNING: 'TS-Deep-LtM with time-series analysis',
  AI_PATTERN_RECOGNITION: '70+ algorithms for trade identification',
  GENETIC_OPTIMIZATION: 'Up to 28.41% returns in backtesting',
  NLP_SENTIMENT: 'Earnings calls, news, social media analysis'
}
```

- **Premium Accounts: €5,000 or $10M monthly volume**
- **Elite Programs: $10M+ trading volume** with cash rebates

**Multi-Factor Classification System:**
```javascript
// Account Level Determination Algorithm
const ACCOUNT_TIERS = {
  BEGINNER: { 
    range: '$1K-$25K', 
    maxPosition: '5%', 
    riskPerTrade: '2%',
    restrictions: ['no-day-trading', 'no-options', 'no-margin']
  },
  INTERMEDIATE: { 
    range: '$25K-$100K', 
    maxPosition: '10%', 
    riskPerTrade: '2%',
    features: ['limited-day-trading', 'basic-options', 'margin-available']
  },

    range: '$100K+', 
    maxPosition: '15%', 
    riskPerTrade: '1-2%',
    features: ['unlimited-day-trading', 'full-options', 'high-leverage']
  }
}
```

### Risk Management Integration

- **Low volatility**: Tighten parameters for precision
- **Volatility-adjusted position sizing** scales with market conditions
- **Dynamic stop-loss adjustments** based on Average True Range (ATR)

**Risk Education Statistics:**
- **Over 90% of traders fail** due to poor risk management
- **2% risk rule**: Professional traders risk 1-2% per trade maximum
- **Dozens of consecutive 2% losses** required to lose entire account
- **Pattern day traders prohibited** from cross-guarantees for margin calls
