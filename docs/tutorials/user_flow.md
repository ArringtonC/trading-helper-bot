# Trading Helper Bot: User Flow (2024, Updated)

## Overview
This document outlines the research-backed, user-centric flow for the application, ensuring every user starts with a clear trading plan, receives personalized analytics, and benefits from robust validation, backup, and continuous improvement features.

---

## 1. Welcome & Simple Goal Setting (Phase 1)
- **Purpose:** Quickly orient the user and set a simple initial objective.
- **Steps:**
  1. Welcome/onboarding (if first time)
  2. Ask "What's your main focus?" (growth, income, risk management, etc.)
  3. Save simple direction to app state
- **Rationale:** Research shows simple onboarding increases completion and engagement.

---

## 2. Import & Analyze Data (Phase 1)
- **Purpose:** Let the user import trade data (CSV, IBKR, etc.) and analyze it in the context of their plan.
- **Steps:**
  1. User uploads/imports trade data
  2. App parses and normalizes trades
  3. Each trade is checked against the user's (simple) plan
  4. UI flags trades that violate the plan, suggests corrections, and provides feedback
- **Integration:**
  - Import/analyze components access initial plan config for validation

---

## 3. Detailed Goal Sizing Wizard (Phase 2)
- **Purpose:** Guide the user to define detailed trading objectives, risk tolerance, and position sizing rules, now with context from their actual data.
- **Steps:**
  1. Launch wizard after first import (or if no valid config exists)
  2. Choose primary goal (growth, drawdown, income, capital objective)
  3. Enter goal-specific parameters (target balance, time horizon, win rate, payoff ratio)
  4. Configure position sizing rules (method, limits, adjustments)
  5. Review & finalize plan (summary, suggested risk fractions, dollar limits)
- **Output:** `GoalSizingConfig` object saved to app state (Context/SQLite/IndexedDB)
- **Rationale:** Research supports detailed goal setting after user has context from their own data.

---

## 4. Plan vs. Reality Analysis (Phase 2+)
- **Purpose:** Validate and improve user's actual trading against their stated plan, creating a continuous improvement cycle.
- **Steps:**
  1. Auto-analyze plan compliance after import
  2. Show real-time violations, insights, and suggestions
  3. Offer one-click plan updates based on actual performance
- **Features:**
  - Compliance dashboard, suggestion cards, scenario modeler
  - Smart feedback loop for plan optimization

---

## 5. Rule Engine & Analytics (Phase 3+)
- **Purpose:** Show the user how their rules would have applied to their actual trades, and provide actionable analytics.
- **Steps:**
  1. Run the rule engine using the user's config and imported trades
  2. Display logs, warnings, and triggered rules
  3. Show dashboards and analytics tailored to the user's plan (P&L, win rate, drawdown, etc.)
  4. Allow user to tweak their plan and immediately see the impact
- **Integration:**
  - Rule engine and analytics components use `GoalSizingConfig` for all calculations and feedback

---

## 6. Continuous Improvement
- **Purpose:** Let users revisit and refine their plan at any time.
- **Features:**
  - "Edit Plan" button/menu item to relaunch the Goal Sizing Wizard
  - When plan is updated, re-validate trades and re-run analytics
  - Progressive disclosure and skip options for power users

---

## 7. Technical Implementation Notes
- Store `GoalSizingConfig` in React Context (infrequent changes) and SQLite/IndexedDB for persistence and backup
- All major components (import, analyze, rule engine, dashboards) should consume this config
- On first app load, show welcome if no config exists; after import, launch wizard; after wizard, route to import/analytics
- Validation: Client-side for UX, DB triggers for integrity
- Backup: IndexedDB for reliability, with auto-restore on corruption
- State management: Context for config, Zustand for future real-time data

---

## 8. Future Extensions
- Add more advanced sizing methods and analytics
- Integrate with live broker APIs for real-time feedback
- Add educational content/contextual help throughout the flow
- Community benchmarking, predictive analytics, machine learning for plan optimization
