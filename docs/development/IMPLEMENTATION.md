# Implementation Guide for Trading Helper Bot

## Project Overview

This guide provides instructions for implementing the Trading Helper Bot using the provided project structure. The application is a comprehensive trading analytics and options dashboard with IBKR integration.

## Recent Progress (Phase 0 Completion)

### âœ… Completed Major Tasks
1. **File Decluttering**: Removed backup files and root directory clutter
2. **IBKR Parser Consolidation**: Consolidated 8 duplicate parser files into 1 organized implementation with updated import references
3. **TypeScript Conversion**: Achieved 95%+ TypeScript conversion rate (489 TS files vs 26 remaining JS files)
4. **Database Schema Fixes**: Resolved critical "no such column: importTimestamp" error and transaction rollback issues

### ðŸ”§ Recent Database Improvements
- **Schema Alignment**: Updated DatabaseService.ts to match NormalizedTradeData interface with comprehensive schema
- **Migration System**: Moved migration functions to proper scope and ensured migrations run during database initialization
- **Anomaly Handling**: Implemented critical anomaly filtering to skip trades with zero prices or missing required fields
- **Transaction Resilience**: Changed from all-or-nothing to best-effort processing, allowing successful trades to be saved even when some fail
- **Error Logging**: Enhanced debugging with detailed trade value logging and better error reporting

## Current Status

The application now has a robust database foundation with proper schema management and resilient transaction handling. The options trading page should load successfully without database errors.

## First Demo Goal

The first demo should deliver a working dashboard that:
1. Shows account information
2. Displays a chart showing $100 monthly deposits through December
3. Has placeholder navigation to Options and Futures modules
4. Allows basic account customization in Settings
5. Runs as a desktop application on macOS

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Project Setup (1-2 hours)

- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS
- [x] Set up folder structure

### 2. Core Components (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Implement Account models
- [ ] Create projection calculation service
- [ ] Build UI components:
  - [ ] Navigation
  - [ ] Account Card
  - [ ] Projection Chart
  - [ ] Projection Summary

### 3. Pages (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Dashboard page
- [ ] Options placeholder page
- [ ] Futures placeholder page
- [ ] Settings page

### 4. Data Storage (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Implement local storage for account data
- [ ] Create account service

### 5. Electron Integration (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Configure Electron for desktop app
- [ ] Set up build process for macOS

### 6. Testing & Polishing (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Verify all features work correctly
- [ ] Polish UI for demo presentation
- [ ] Test on macOS

## Implementation Notes

### Account Data Structure
Use the provided Account model:
```typescript
interface Account {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: AccountType;
  balance: number;
  lastUpdated: Date;
  monthlyDeposit?: number;
}
```

### Projection Calculation
Follow this algorithm for calculating monthly projections:
1. Start with current account balance
2. Add monthly deposit for each month remaining in 2025
3. Store month name and balance in projection array
4. Display in chart component

### Local Storage
Store account data in browser localStorage to persist between sessions.

### UI Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the provided UI mockups
- Ensure responsive design for different window sizes

## Testing Points
1. Account creation and update
2. Monthly deposit addition
3. Projection calculations
4. Chart rendering
5. Navigation between pages
6. Settings persistence

## Preparing for the Demo
1. Create a simple installer or executable
2. Prepare a demonstration script
3. Create sample account with initial data
4. Prepare to show chart updating with monthly deposits

## Future Integration Notes
- Plan for C# compatibility with NinjaTrader
- Design modules with future AI strategy integration in mind
- Document APIs for integration points
