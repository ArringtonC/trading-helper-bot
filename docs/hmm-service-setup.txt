# HMM Service Setup & Troubleshooting

To use ML-powered trade analysis, you must start the Python backend service:

## Start the Service

1. Open a terminal in your project root.
2. Run:
   cd hmm-service && python3 app.py
3. Wait for:
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
4. Refresh the AI Analysis page in your app.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see 'Failed to fetch' or 'Not Running' in the UI, the backend is not running.
- Make sure Python 3 is installed (`python3 --version`).
- If you get a port error, make sure nothing else is using port 5000.
- If you see CORS errors, ensure `flask_cors` is installed and enabled in `app.py`.
- For advanced debugging, check the backend logs in the terminal.

## Automation (Advanced)
- For full automation, consider a Node/Electron backend that can spawn Python processes (requires extra setup and permissions).
