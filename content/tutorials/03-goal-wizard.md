# Using the Goal Sizing Wizard

The Goal Sizing Wizard helps you align your trading with your financial objectives.

1.  **Define Your Capital Objective:** How much do you want to grow your account?
2.  **Set Risk Tolerance:** Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive?
3.  **Input Trade Statistics:** Average win rate, win/loss ratio.

The wizard will then suggest appropriate position sizes.
