# Understanding Your Risk Gauges

Real-time risk gauges are crucial for managing your options positions.

*   **Delta:** Shows your directional exposure.
*   **Theta:** Indicates time decay.
*   **Gamma:** Measures the rate of change of Delta.
*   **Vega:** Reflects sensitivity to implied volatility.

Keep an eye on these, especially for 0DTE trades!
