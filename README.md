# Stock Screening Implementation Guide
## Research Questions & Code Structure - Organized by Development Flow

---

## SECTION A: USER EXPERIENCE & INTERFACE DESIGN
*Start here - the foundation of everything*

### 1. USER FLOW & NAVIGATION STRATEGY

**Research Questions:**
- What's the optimal step-by-step flow from goal-setting to stock selection?
- How do you design intuitive navigation between screening, results, and details?
- What onboarding flows work best for trading apps that don't overwhelm beginners?
- How do you minimize decision fatigue while maintaining functionality?
- What breadcrumb and progress indicators help users understand where they are?
- How do you handle back/forward navigation without losing screening context?
- What shortcuts work for experienced users without confusing beginners?

**Research Findings:**
The most effective trading app flow begins with **goal clarification before technical analysis**. A proven process starts with annual reflection and specific goal setting, where traders identify their objectives and create measurable targets. The optimal workflow follows this sequence:

1. **Initial Goal Definition**: Users set specific, measurable trading goals with clear timeframes rather than vague aspirations
2. **Strategy Alignment**: The system helps users match their goals to appropriate trading strategies based on their risk tolerance and timeline
3. **Market Education**: Progressive disclosure of educational content tailored to the user's experience level
4. **Screening Parameters**: Guided setup of screening criteria that align with established goals
5. **Stock Selection**: Filtered results presentation with clear rationale for recommendations

**Navigation Best Practices:**
- **Tab-based navigation** for main sections (screening, portfolio, research, settings)
- **Breadcrumb trails** for complex hierarchies, especially in screening flows
- **Contextual back buttons** that preserve user's screening parameters
- **Funnel approach**: Industry/Sector Selection → Criteria Refinement → Results Display → Detail Views
- **Parameter persistence**: Save screening criteria in app state or local storage
- **Smart back navigation**: Distinguish between in-stack and cross-stack navigation

**Code Structure:**
```javascript
class UserFlowManager {
  initializeOnboarding(newUser) {}
  manageScreeningSession(userState) {}
  handleNavigation(currentStep, nextStep) {}
  preserveUserContext(sessionData) {}
  createIntegrationLinks(targetSection) {}
  manageProgressIndicators(currentStep, totalSteps) {}
  
  // Context preservation for navigation
  preserveScreeningContext(filters, results) {
    return {
      returnScreen: 'ScreeningResults',
      filters: currentFilters,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    }
  }
}

const USER_JOURNEY = {
  ONBOARDING: 'Goals → Account Level → Preferences',
  SCREENING: 'Simple Filters → Results → Details',
  SELECTION: 'Review → Save → Connect to Broker'
}
```

### 2. SIMPLE VISUAL DESIGN & LAYOUT

**Research Questions:**
- What UI patterns work best for financial apps used by beginners?
- How do you present complex screening data without overwhelming new users?
- What's the optimal information hierarchy for stock screening results?
- Card vs List vs Table layouts - which works best for different user types?
- What color coding systems effectively communicate risk levels and goal alignment?
- How do you use icons and visual cues to quickly communicate stock characteristics?
- What typography hierarchy ensures scannability and comprehension?
- How do you design progressive disclosure to reveal more details as needed?

**Research Findings:**

**UI Patterns for Beginners:**
Financial apps designed for beginners require **simplified interfaces that prioritize usability over advanced functionality**. The most effective patterns include:
- **Minimalistic design approach** that reduces complexity and allows users to focus on managing their finances without distractions
- **Progressive onboarding** with step-by-step guidance through account activation with personalized prompts
- **Familiar interaction patterns** that build on users' smartphone familiarity to reduce learning curve

**Information Hierarchy (Three-Tier System):**
- **Primary Level**: Stock name, current price, and goal match indicators (most prominent)
- **Secondary Level**: Key metrics like risk level, industry classification, and basic performance data
- **Tertiary Level**: Detailed financials, technical analysis data, and advanced metrics (revealed through progressive disclosure)

**Layout Selection by User Type:**
- **Card Views** work best for beginners when users need to focus on individual stock details with multi-dimensional attributes
- **Table Views** excel for advanced users who need to compare objects with attributes directly aligned in scannable columns
- **List Views** serve as middle ground, effective for mobile displays with limited horizontal space

**Color Coding Standards:**
- **Risk Level 1**: Green (#A5D796) - Low risk
- **Risk Level 2**: Blue (#3366CC) - Moderate-low risk  
- **Risk Level 3**: Yellow (#E3B52A) - Moderate risk
- **Risk Level 4**: Orange (#DA7706) - High risk
- **Risk Level 5**: Red (#B90D0D) - Very high risk

**Typography Requirements:**
- **Typography hierarchy should follow a 3:1 ratio for headers to body text size**
- **Modern Sans Serif fonts** (Montserrat, Futura Medium, Overpass) communicate strength, reliability, and stability
- **Visual hierarchy enables viewers to get information quicker** with contrast and spacing having the most influence on effectiveness

**Progressive Disclosure Patterns:**
- **Modal Windows**: Open in front of main UI to provide extra functions
- **Accordions**: Expand and collapse content sections to optimize space
- **Tabs**: Divide content into panels while displaying only one at a time
- **Tooltips**: Reveal extra information when hovered over
- **Limit layers to typically one secondary screen per instance** to avoid confusing users

**Code Structure:**
```javascript
class SimpleUIComponents {
  renderStockCard(stock, userLevel, goals) {
    // Implement progressive complexity based on userLevel
    // Show goal alignment prominently for beginners
    // Use appropriate color coding for risk levels
    return {
      primary: { name: stock.name, price: stock.price, goalMatch: this.calculateGoalAlignment(stock, goals) },
      secondary: { riskLevel: stock.risk, industry: stock.sector, performance: stock.ytdReturn },
      tertiary: { financials: stock.fundamentals, technical: stock.technicals } // Progressive disclosure
    }
  }
  
  createFilterInterface(complexity) {
    // Start with basic filters for beginners
    // Progressive disclosure for advanced options
    // Visual hierarchy with clear primary/secondary options
    if (complexity === 'beginner') {
      return this.renderGuidedFilters()
    }
    return this.renderAdvancedFilters()
  }
  
  displayResultsGrid(stocks, sortBy, viewMode, userLevel) {
    // Card view for beginners, table for advanced users
    // Consistent visual hierarchy across all view modes
    // Clear sorting and filtering feedback
    const layout = userLevel === 'beginner' ? 'cards' : 'table'
    return this.renderLayout(layout, stocks, sortBy)
  }
  
  showGoalAlignment(stock, userGoals) {
    // Visual indicators for goal match
    // Color coding for alignment strength
    // Clear explanation of why stock matches goals
  }
  
  renderProgressiveDisclosure(basicInfo, detailedInfo) {
    // Keep important information visible
    // Make advanced functions discoverable with clear signifiers
    // Provide contextual help through tooltips
  }
  
  createVisualIndicators(riskLevel, goalMatch) {
    // Universal icon standards for stock characteristics
    // Industry sector indicators
    // Performance trends (up/down arrows)
    // Risk level indicators (color-coded shields)
  }
}

const VISUAL_HIERARCHY = {
  PRIMARY: 'Stock name, price, goal match indicator',
  SECONDARY: 'Key metrics, risk level, industry',  
  TERTIARY: 'Detailed financials, technical data'
}

const UI_PATTERNS = {
  BEGINNER_VIEW: { cards: true, details: 'minimal', filters: 'guided' },
  INTERMEDIATE_VIEW: { cards: true, details: 'medium', filters: 'semi-custom' },
  ADVANCED_VIEW: { table: true, details: 'full', filters: 'custom' }
}
```

### 3. MOBILE & RESPONSIVE DESIGN

**Research Questions:**
- How do you optimize stock screening for mobile devices?
- What touch interactions work best for filtering and selection?
- How do you handle large data tables on small screens?
- What's the best way to display complex financial data on mobile?
- How do you ensure the app works well across different screen sizes?
- What offline capabilities are essential for screening apps?

**Research Findings:**

**Mobile Optimization Principles:**
- **Start Small, Scale Up**: Mobile-first design starting with **360 x 640 pixels baseline** for Android devices, ensuring every element must earn its place
- **Performance Optimization**: Apps must work efficiently in **low bandwidth scenarios** using **proprietary binary protocols for market data delivery** with compression techniques
- **Simplified Interface Architecture**: **Prioritize usability over advanced functionality** with progressive onboarding that reduces learning curve

**Touch Interaction Best Practices:**
- **Gesture-Based Navigation**: Implement **swipes and taps to make trading stocks feel more like checking email**
- **Multi-Touch Support**: Advanced platforms use **two-finger swipe that pans charts in the direction you're swiping**
- **Touch-Friendly Controls**: Use **larger buttons, readable fonts, proportionate images** with **minimum 44px touch targets**
- **Interactive Elements**: Include **interactive charts with real-time data** and **portfolio editing right from the chart**

**Large Data Table Solutions:**
- **Card-Based Layout**: **Transform rows into cards to display essential information clearly** - this is the **optimal way to display complete data records without horizontal scrolling**
- **Avoid Horizontal Scrolling**: **Horizontal scrolling is often imprecise and annoying for users** - card format allows **users to only scroll vertically to view more data records**
- **Progressive Information Display**: Use **three-tier hierarchy** with headers containing record ID and checkboxes, restricting **initial UI to high-level summaries** with detailed data on demand

**Complex Financial Data Display:**
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Typography hierarchy with **3:1 ratio for headers to body text** ensuring users can **quickly scan and identify relevant information**
- **Contextual Information**: **Visual cues such as icons, colors, and animations guide users more effectively than text-heavy instructions**
- **Adaptive Display**: Use **tabs inside tables when views are repeating** to optimize space and organize information

**Cross-Screen Compatibility:**
- **Breakpoint Strategy**: Key width breakpoints - **Small (smaller than 640px), Medium (641px to 1007px), Large (1008px and larger)**
- **Common Resolutions**: Account for **360×800, 390×844, 393×873** (mobile), **768×1024, 810×1080, 820×1180** (tablets), **1920×1080, 1536×864, 1366×768** (desktop)
- **Auto-Layout Systems**: Use **auto-layout that fills width and leaves consistent margins** ensuring **designs stay proportional**

**Essential Offline Capabilities:**
- **Local Data Storage**: **Store data locally in SQLite database** so **app always works smoothly** with **no connection needed except for synchronizing**
- **Core Offline Features**: Enable **analysis of 35,000+ global stocks without constant internet** after initial download, with **comprehensive metrics covering company information, growth rates, profitability**
- **Synchronization Strategy**: **When user starts app with connection, check for newer version** and **automatically update device with data synchronization**

**Code Structure:**
```javascript
class ResponsiveDesign {
  optimizeForMobile(componentType) {
    // Implement progressive complexity based on screen size
    // Use card layouts for data tables on mobile
    // Apply mobile-first design principles starting at 360px
    if (this.getScreenWidth() < 640) {
      return this.renderMobileOptimized(componentType)
    }
    return this.renderDesktopVersion(componentType)
  }
  
  createTouchFriendlyControls() {
    // Implement larger touch targets (minimum 44px)
    // Add gesture recognition for swipe and pinch
    // Provide haptic feedback for interactions
    return {
      buttonSize: '44px',
      gestures: ['swipe', 'pinch', 'tap'],
      hapticFeedback: true
    }
  }
  
  handleLargeDatasets(screenSize) {
    // Transform tables to cards for mobile
    // Implement progressive disclosure
    // Use virtual scrolling for performance
    if (screenSize === 'mobile') {
      return this.transformTableToCards()
    }
    return this.renderResponsiveTable()
  }
  
  adaptLayoutToScreen(screenWidth) {
    // Apply breakpoint-based responsive design
    // Adjust typography scale ratios (3:1 for headers)
    // Modify navigation patterns by screen size
    const breakpoint = this.getBreakpoint(screenWidth)
    return this.applyBreakpointStyles(breakpoint)
  }
  
  manageOfflineCapabilities() {
    // Implement local SQLite storage
    // Handle data synchronization when online
    // Provide offline screening for 35,000+ stocks
    return {
      localStorage: 'sqlite',
      syncStrategy: 'whenOnline',
      offlineStocks: 35000
    }
  }
  
  // Mobile-specific methods
  transformTableToCards() {
    // Convert table rows to card format
    // Header on left, data on right with dividers
    // Eliminate horizontal scrolling
  }
  
  getBreakpoint(width) {
    if (width < 640) return 'small'
    if (width <= 1007) return 'medium'  
    return 'large'
  }
}

const MOBILE_BREAKPOINTS = {
  SMALL: { maxWidth: '640px', layout: 'cards' },

## SECTION B: TRADER GOALS & PERSONALIZATION
*The intelligence that makes screening relevant*

### 4. GOAL IDENTIFICATION & QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN

**Research Questions:**
- What are the most common trading goals for new traders?
- What questions effectively identify a trader's true objectives vs stated goals?
- How do you design questionnaires that aren't overwhelming for beginners?
- How do you handle conflicting goals (wanting safety AND quick profits)?
- What psychological factors affect goal-setting in trading?
- How do you educate traders on realistic expectations for their account size?
- What onboarding flow best captures goals without intimidating new users?

**Research Findings:**

**Most Common Trading Goals:**
New traders typically enter the market with several key objectives: **building wealth, generating passive income, and achieving financial independence**. However, **many new traders miss out on setting goals, and having clear and realistic goals is important because it helps traders stay focused and motivated**. Research shows that **most traders think in terms of performance instead of result, where results are monetary goals while performance goals focus on risk vs reward, minimizing drawdown or volatility**.

**Five Primary Goal Categories:**
1. **Income Generation**: Focus on **dividend-focused criteria, REIT considerations, utility stocks** with **low payout ratio and respectable current dividend rate**
2. **Growth Seeking**: Emphasis on **small-cap vs large-cap growth, momentum indicators** where **small-cap stocks are generally considered riskier and more profitable than large-cap stocks**
3. **Capital Preservation**: Prioritizing **blue chip stocks, defensive sectors, low-beta stocks** as **defensive investors often include blue-chip stocks due to their perceived reliability**
4. **Learning/Practice**: Utilizing **educational stock picks, mistake-friendly choices** through **paper trading and simulated trading environments**
5. **Active Trading**: Engaging in **day trading setups, volatility plays with appropriate warnings** where **day trading is a high-risk strategy with high chance of losses**

**Effective Assessment Questions:**
Core questions for identifying true objectives vs stated goals:
- **What is my motivation for trading, i.e., why do I want to trade?**
- **How much time can I give to trading?**
- **What is my attitude toward risk?**
- **What will I be trading? (Stocks, bonds, options, futures?)**
- **How will I measure my goals?**
- **What is my timeline to reach each goal?**
- **Is each goal SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound)?**

**Risk Assessment Integration:**
Questionnaires should incorporate **risk tolerance assessment that considers how much risk you can take, based on your investment time horizon and other factors**. **Risk tolerance score ranges from zero (most conservative) to 100 (most aggressive)**.

**Progressive Disclosure for Beginners:**
- **Collect essential information only during sign-up/registration to be as swift as possible**
- **Progressive disclosure reduces cognitive load by gradually revealing more complex information as users progress**
- **Frontload the value - when users open the app, remind them why they downloaded it**
- **Keep important information visible by defining essential and advanced content through user research**

**Handling Conflicting Goals:**
**Unfortunately, safety and quick profits are somewhat contradictory. The pursuit of profit normally involves some element of risk, so it isn't really possible to maximize both**. The solution involves **educating traders on the nature of goal interdependencies and helping them understand that sustainable profitability requires accepting appropriate risk levels**.

**Psychological Factors:**
**Trading psychology refers to the emotional and mental aspects that influence trading decisions. It's the interplay of emotions like fear, greed, and hope that can lead to irrational decision-making**. Key biases affecting goal-setting include:
- **Projection Bias**: Projecting current emotions onto future market conditions
- **Overconfidence Bias**: Overestimating trading abilities, ignoring stop-losses
- **Loss Aversion**: Feeling losses more deeply than gains

**Realistic Expectations Education:**
**A trader that aims to achieve a 10% return in six months - for some people this is realistic, for others unrealistic**. **Someone wanting to make 30% a month with $500 capital - that's measurable but not achievable or realistic**. **Pattern day traders are required to maintain a minimum equity of $25,000** for unlimited day trading.

**Goal Categories Research:**
- **Income Generation**: Companies with **history of steady dividend growth, low payout ratio, current ratio of 2 or higher**
- **Growth Seeking**: **Market cap less than $1.0B, EPS growth in top 20%, PEG ratio ≤ 2.0**
- **Capital Preservation**: **Defensive portfolios with stable earnings, low volatility, consistent dividends**
- **Learning/Practice**: **Paper trading with simulated environments, no real money at risk**
- **Active Trading**: **High-risk strategies requiring $25K minimum, volatility plays with appropriate warnings**

**Code Structure:**
```javascript
class GoalIdentificationSystem {
  createGoalQuestionnaire(userLevel) {
    // Implement progressive disclosure based on experience
    // Use SMART goal framework for question structure
    // Include risk tolerance assessment with 0-100 scoring

  }
  
  educateOnExpectations(goals, accountLevel) {
    // Deliver account-size appropriate education
    // Show historical performance data for goal categories

    const education = this.getEducationContent(goals, accountLevel)
    return this.createLearningPath(education)
  }
  
  detectGoalConflicts(goals) {
    // Identify contradictory objectives (safety + high returns)
    // Flag unrealistic combinations
    // Suggest priority ranking for conflicting goals

### 5. TEMPLATE SYSTEM & GOAL-BASED MATCHING

**Research Questions:**
- What template structures work best for different goal types?
- How do you create templates that evolve with trader experience?
- How do you automatically match stock characteristics to trader goals?
- What algorithms best align stock attributes with objectives?
- What feedback mechanisms improve goal-to-stock matching accuracy?
- What warning systems alert traders when their picks don't match their stated goals?

**Research Findings:**

**Template Structures by Goal Type:**
**The most effective template designs follow fundamental investment categories with customizable parameters that adapt to trader goals**. Each goal type requires specific structural approaches:

**Income Generation Templates:**
- **Low payout ratio and respectable current dividend rate filters**
- **Current ratio of 2 or higher as an indicator of ability to cover short-term obligations**
- **History of steady dividend growth as an indicator of healthy corporate fiscal policy**
- **Templates should restrict initial UI to high-level summaries allowing users to grasp general trends at a glance**

**Growth Seeking Templates:**
- **Market Capitalization filters: Less than or Equal to $1.0B for small-cap focus**
- **EPS Growth projections comparing current quarter vs same quarter prior year**
- **PEG Ratio filters: Less than or Equal to 2.0**
- **Small-cap stocks are generally considered to be riskier and more profitable than large-cap stocks** (requires risk warnings)

**Capital Preservation Templates:**
- **Blue-chip stock filters for perceived reliability and long-term growth potential**
- **Low volatility screening parameters**
- **Defensive sector categorization**
- Focus on **companies with stable earnings, low volatility, and consistent dividends**

**Active Trading Templates:**
- **Pattern day trader requirements maintaining minimum equity of $25,000**
- **Volatility-based screening parameters**
- **Real-time momentum indicators**
- **Must include appropriate warnings as day trading is a high-risk strategy with high chance of losses**

**Template Evolution with Experience:**
**Adaptive trading strategies are systems with rules that change depending on the market regime**. **Template Based Evolution (TBE) uses genetic evolution algorithms that evolve behavior for agents whose fitness is tested implicitly through repeated trials**.

Progressive Complexity Framework:
- **Beginner templates with simplified interfaces that prioritize usability over advanced functionality**
- **Intermediate templates introducing progressive disclosure techniques that help users navigate complex data sets without feeling overwhelmed**
- **Advanced templates with customizable interfaces allowing power users to personalize layouts and quick actions**

**Automatic Stock-to-Goal Matching Algorithms:**
**Stock selection has been transformed into a matching problem between groups of stocks and stock selection targets**. Modern systems employ:

**Deep Matching Algorithms:**
- **TS-Deep-LtM algorithm sets statistical indicators to filter and integrate three deep text matching algorithms**
- **Stock feature matrices extending historical feature vectors across multiple time windows**
- **Parallel framework design making it good at capturing signals from time-series data**

**AI Integration:**
- **AI stock screeners use machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns, predict market movements and find trades with higher accuracy than traditional methods**
- **Holly AI scans over 70 investment algorithms daily** to identify optimal matches
- **Trade Ideas processes massive amounts of market data in real time and finds trade setups before they hit most traders' radar**

**Multi-Factor Screening:**
- **Stock screeners help filter the market showing only stocks that meet specific criteria**
- **Five basic valuation categories: P/E ratio, PEG ratio, price-to-book ratio, price-to-sales ratio, and short ratio**
- **EquitySet uses natural language processing to analyze earnings calls, news releases and social media sentiment along with traditional market data**

**Performance Validation:**
- **Stock screeners based on genetic algorithms have demonstrated returns up to 28.41% in 1 month**
- **I Know First's algorithm correctly predicted 9 out of 10 stock movements** using genetic algorithm approaches
- **TS-Deep-LtM algorithm achieved 30% or 2%-15% higher annualized returns than CSI300 index or classical learning-to-rank approaches**

**Warning Systems for Goal-Stock Mismatch:**
**Order-flow analysis with patented technology provides real-time alerts, historical recaps, directional trades, and unusual option activity detection**. Comprehensive warning systems include:

**Real-Time Alert Mechanisms:**
- **Early Warning System signals traders of impending turning points in stock trading trajectory**
- **Red dots and green dots indicate high probability of trend direction changes**
- **Trade Alert provides cutting-edge order-flow analysis adding real-time context to market activity**

**Risk Management Integration:**
- **Over 90% of traders fail and lose money because they don't understand how to manage risk**
- **Pattern day traders are required to maintain minimum equity of $25,000** - warnings when attempting strategies requiring higher minimums
- **Goal modification notifications trigger when goals are copied between plans** with audit trail maintenance

## SECTION C: ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT & RISK FRAMEWORK
*Ensuring appropriate recommendations for user's situation*

### 6. ACCOUNT LEVEL CLASSIFICATION

**Research Questions:**
- What are the standard account size t
### 6. ACCOUNT LEVEL CLASSIFICATION

**Research Questions:**
- What are the standard account size tiers used by brokers and trading platforms?
- How should account levels be determined? (Balance only, or balance + experience + trading frequency?)
- What are the risk management guidelines for each account level?
- Should the system allow manual override of auto-detected account levels?
- How do you handle accounts that grow between levels?
- What are appropriate position sizing guidelines for each level?

**Research Findings:**

**Standard Account Tiers:**
Trading platforms typically implement **standardized account tier systems based on regulatory requirements and risk management practices**. The foundation follows regulatory thresholds:

**Regulatory Foundation:**
- **Cash Account Minimum: $0 to open basic accounts, with some requiring up to $2,500 for certain services**
- **Margin Account Minimum: $2,000 as mandated by Regulation T**
- **Pattern Day Trading Threshold: $25,000 minimum equity required** for unlimited day trading
- **Traders who execute four or more day trades within five business days must maintain this balance**

**Professional Platform Tiers:**
- **Premium accounts typically require starting deposits of €5,000 or average monthly trading volume of $10,000,000**
- **Elite trader programs require minimum trading volumes from $10 million with cash rebates ranging from $5 per million traded**

**Multi-Factor Classification:**
Modern account systems should incorporate **multiple factors beyond simple balance thresholds** to accurately assess trader capabilities:

**Experience-Based Classification:**
- **Level 1 traders are beginners full of enthusiasm but underestimate dangers of trading on margin, with 20-30% quitting at this stage**
- **Level 2 represents the student phase where traders realize immense complexity and begin jumping from strategy to strategy**
- **Advanced traders demonstrate ability to look at additional inputs and use those inputs to vary position sizing**

**Trading Frequency Assessment:**
- **Active trading strategies encompass four approaches: scalping, day trading, swing trading, and position trading**
- **Day traders focus on minute charts while positional investors utilize weekly patterns**
- Each approach requires different account minimums and risk management protocols

**Risk Management Guidelines by Level:**

**Beginner Level ($1K-$25K):**
- **Most professional traders risk 1% to 2% of total capital on any single trade**
- **For a $10,000 account risking 2% per trade, maximum loss per trade should not exceed $200**
- **Position sizing should follow the 2% rule, never putting more than 2% of account equity at risk**
- **Using this threshold, a trader would need dozens of consecutive 2% losing trades to lose all money**

**Intermediate Level ($25K-$100K):**
- **Intermediate traders can implement volatility-based position sizing, adjusting trade sizes according to market volatility**
- **More volatile assets require smaller position sizes while less volatile assets allow larger positions**
- **Risk management should incorporate Average True Range (ATR) for measuring volatility and determining stop-loss placement**
- **Position sizes calculated using: Position Size = Account Risk ÷ Trade Risk**

**Advanced Level ($100K+):**
- **Advanced traders can utilize more sophisticated risk management including cross-guarantees and complex derivatives**
- **However, pattern day traders are prohibited from utilizing cross guarantees to meet day-trading margin calls**
- **Advanced accounts can access higher leverage ratios up to 1:200 for professional accounts compared to 1:30 for retail accounts**

**Manual Override Systems:**
**Trading systems should implement broker override functions that allow individuals with permission to override routing setups**. Key requirements:
- **Users must be setup as Level 4 or above for override functionality**
- **Manual adjustments can be made on contract and prompt levels for orderly trading**
- **Override systems should serve as final backstops for pre-trade risk functionality**
- **Automated fake account detection systems employ machine-learned models at registration that evaluate abuse risk scores**

**Account Growth Transition Management:**
**Account tiering should be regularly re-evaluated quarterly, bi-annually, or annually depending on industry dynamics**. Effective transition management includes:

**Dynamic Tier Progression:**
- **Account growth triggers should incorporate changes in account engagement, intent signals, and company growth trajectories**
- **Effective systems should automatically adjust position sizing and risk parameters as accounts transition between tiers**
- **When accounts grow between levels, systems should implement graduated increases in trading privileges rather than immediate jumps**

**Position Sizing Guidelines:**
**Fixed percentage risk represents one of the most popular position sizing methods, involving risking a fixed percentage of total account balance per trade**:

- **Beginners (under $25K): Never exceed 5% of total account value in any single position**
- **Intermediate ($25K-$100K): Can allocate up to 10% per position with appropriate diversification**
- **Advanced ($100K+): May allocate up to 15% per position but must demonstrate sophisticated risk management**

**Volatility-Adjusted Sizing:**
- **Volatility-based position sizing aligns risk exposure with market conditions**
- **Higher volatility implies larger potential price swings requiring smaller position sizes**
- **Position sizing using volatility involves adjusting shares/contracts based on asset's historical price fluctuations**

### 7. RISK MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION

**Research Questions:**
- How do you integrate screening with existing risk management tools?
- What risk parameters should automatically filter out inappropriate stocks?
- How do you calculate and display risk metrics for screened stocks?
- What correlation analysis prevents over-concentration in similar stocks?
- How do you adjust risk parameters based on market conditions?
- What educational content helps users understand risk in their selections?

**Research Findings:**

**Unified Risk Architecture:**
**AI and machine learning algorithms automate risk and compliance screening, processing alerts with consistency and accuracy while delivering more precise results and significant reduction in false positives**. **Investment Risk Manager's multi-asset class factor model integrates with best-of-breed simulation engines, enabling modeling of complex derivatives using over 200 pricing models**.

Effective integration requires **a hybrid risk analytics platform that combines proprietary software and vended risk models into a highly automated risk reporting infrastructure**. **This integrated approach marries risk management with investment analytics to monitor each team's investment process through time, identifying sources of alpha and risk**.

**Automated Risk Parameters:**
**A robust stock screening strategy relies heavily on understanding and interpreting various financial health and risk metrics, including debt-to-equity ratio, current ratio, quick ratio, beta, and enterprise value**. **Current ratio of 2 or higher serves as a good indicator of ability to cover short-term obligations**.

**Beta measures the volatility or systematic risk of a fund in comparison to the market or selected benchmark index, with a beta of one indicating the fund is expected to move in conjunction with the benchmark**. **Assets with high beta values are called aggressive, while assets with low beta values are called defensive**. **Companies with beta greater than 1 are more volatile than the market, while companies with beta lower than 1 are less volatile**.

**Risk Metric Calculations:**
**The five principal risk measures include alpha, beta, R-squared, standard deviation, and the Sharpe ratio, each providing a unique way to assess the risk present in investments**. **Alpha measures risk relative to the market or selected benchmark index, with positive alpha indicating outperformance of the benchmark**. **The Sharpe ratio measures the profit of an investment that exceeds the risk-free rate per unit of standard deviation**.

**Risk-adjusted returns measure an investment's return by examining how much risk is taken in obtaining the return, using five measures including Alpha, Beta, R-squared, Standard Deviation and Sharpe Ratio**. **AI Portfolio Insights provides actionable risk and performance insights, integrating risk management into investment decision processes using GenAI to increase speed, create efficiencies and enhance collaboration**.

**Correlation Analysis for Diversification:**
**Correlation is a statistical relationship between asset prices represented by a coefficient measuring on a scale of -1 to 1 how likely it is that the price of two assets will move together**. **Perfect positive correlation has a value of 1 meaning assets move in the same direction and proportion 100% of the time, while perfect negative correlation has a value of -1**.

**Strong positive correlation (0.5 to 1) indicates assets that move together, increasing the risk of simultaneous losses or gains, while diversifying with securities that have low or negative correlation can help reduce overall portfolio risk**. **Weak or no correlation (0 to 0.5) represents assets with limited or no relationship, providing diversification benefits**. **Negative correlation (-1 to 0) offers potential risk mitigation through diversification as assets move in opposite directions**.

**Concentration Risk Controls:**
**Sector concentration risk occurs when a portfolio has significant exposure to a particular industry or sector, resulting in losses if the sector experiences a downturn**. **Geographic concentration risk arises when a portfolio has significant exposure to a particular geographic area, potentially resulting from economic or political instability**. **Asset allocation involves distributing investments across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate to reduce the impact of concentration risk**.

**Market Condition Adjustments:**
**Market volatility brings increased opportunity to profit in a shorter amount of time, but also carries increased risk, with risk control measures such as stop losses gaining importance when markets are more volatile**. **Volatility-adjusted means guide trades by comparing short- and long-term trends while avoiding high volatility periods, with volatility adjustment scaling means by historical volatility to normalize for different market conditions**.

**The Volatility-Adjusted Rate of Change model adjusts sensitivity of signals based on market volatility, ensuring strategy adaptation to changing market conditions**. **When volatility is high, thresholds are widened to filter out noise and avoid unnecessary trades, while during low volatility periods, thresholds tighten to capture smaller price movements**.

**Educational Risk Framework:**
**Trading education resources include technical analysis tools, market analytics, video libraries, practice accounts, and trading communities, with structured learning programs offering clear progression paths and mentor feedback**. **Risk management in futures and options trading involves a comprehensive process of identifying, meticulously evaluating, and effectively mitigating risks inherent in trading activities**. **Proper risk management is about foresight and preparation, involving assessment of potential market scenarios and their impact on trading positions**.

## SECTION D: STOCK DISCOVERY & FILTERING LOGIC
*The core screening functionality*

### 8. CURATED STOCK LISTS & BEGINNER-FRIENDLY CATEGORIES

**Research Questions:**
- How do you identify and maintain "stocks of the year" lists?
- What criteria define "stocks to buy early" vs established stocks?
- How do you categorize stocks as "stable" vs "growth" vs "value"?
- What's the best way to show top 2-3 stocks per major industry?
- How do you distinguish between "old stocks" (established) vs "new stocks" (recent IPOs)?
- Should these lists be automated or manually curated?
- How often should curated lists be updated?
- What performance metrics best identify "beginner-friendly" stocks?

**Research Findings:**

**"Stocks of the Year" Identification:**
**Goldman Sachs created the "Rule of 10" to identify the next wave of stocks poised to soar in value, requiring companies to consistently generate sales growth of 10% and be capable of continuing to do so in the future**. **In early 2025, 21 S&P 500 stocks meet Goldman's revenue criteria**, demonstrating the effectiveness of systematic screening approaches.

**The most robust annual stock selection process follows three-step approaches to evaluating stocks, beginning with quantitative assessment by ranking securities based on various metrics such as growth, gross profits, return on invested capital (ROIC), debt levels, and stock buybacks**. **Analysis indicates that companies in the top decile outperform those in lower deciles by approximately 400 basis points annually over the past two decades**.

**Quality-Based Filtering:**
**High-quality stocks historically outperform the market with less volatility, with the high-quality portfolio including the 30% of stocks with the highest operating profitability outperforming low-quality portfolios by more than 4.5% per year since 1990**. **The high-quality portfolio also outperforms the market by 1.4% per year while delivering lower volatility**.

**Early Stage vs Established Stock Criteria:**

**Early Stage Characteristics:**
- **High revenue growth rates, capturing market share rapidly and expanding customer base through innovation, strategic acquisitions, or entry into new markets**
- **Growth companies usually have an edge over competitors in the form of an innovative product, and these companies tend to reinvest a great deal of their profits back into the business**
- **Limited to No (Or Low) Dividend Payments as companies reinvest profits for growth**
- **Strong Market Position carrying competitive advantage or unique value proposition**

**Established Stock Features:**
- **Blue-chip stocks are well-established companies that have a large market capitalization with long successful track records of generating dependable earnings and leading within their industry or sector**
- **Quality stocks benefit from strong business models and steady financial results over time, with financial performance that is more consistent and predictable**
- **Established companies demonstrate competitive advantage through sustainable competitive edge that often dominate their markets and have strong pricing power**
- **Consistent earnings growth tends to show consistent earnings growth or stability**

**Stock Categorization System:**

**Growth Stock Classification:**
- **Growth stocks are distinguished by their ability to generate high revenue growth rates and capture market share rapidly**
- **The goal of growth screens is to find small cap stocks with growth rates in the top 20% of the market**
- **Key growth characteristics include profitability where companies have positive earnings and are growing those earnings, plus low (or no) debt and strong balance sheets**
- **Large target markets are preferred as companies need substantial addressable markets for significant growth potential**

**Value Stock Identification:**
- **Benjamin Graham's value stock criteria includes quality rating that is average or better, debt to current asset ratios of less than 1.10, current ratio over 1.50, and positive earnings per share growth during the past five years**
- **Value screening considers stocks with above-average dividend yield (but not too high), low P/E ratio, and price that is less than the company's book value**
- **The best metrics to find undervalued stocks include valuation ratios like P/E, P/B, and EV/EBITDA, as well as growth indicators like EPS growth and revenue growth**

**Stable Stock Characteristics:**
- **Stable stocks exhibit four key characteristics: reliable outperformance over the long term, resilient behavior across the business cycle, defensiveness in crises, and asymmetric risk profile**
- **Successful companies include competitive advantage, above-average management, and market leadership, with investors looking to financial indicators such as stable earnings, return on equity (ROE), and relative value comparisons**
- **Consistent growth with good track records of consistent earnings growth demonstrates ability to perform well even in slower economic times**

**Industry Leadership Display:**
**Stock market sectors show Technology Services with 16.78 T USD market cap, Finance with 14.41 T USD, Electronic Technology with 13.38 T USD, Health Technology with 6.24 T USD, and Retail Trade with 5.86 T USD**. **Top stocks by sector include T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) for Communication Services, Lowe's Cos. Inc. (LOW) for Consumer Discretionary, Coca-Cola Co. (KO) for Consumer Staples, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) for Energy**.

**Market Leading criterion includes stocks with overall sales that are 1.5 times greater than the average stock, with emphasis on strong sales and low price-to-sales ratio**. **Market Leaders also have higher cash flow per share than the average stock**.

**Established vs IPO Classification:**
**Upcoming IPOs in 2025 include CoreWeave Inc. with estimated valuation of $35.0 billion, Stripe Inc. at $91.5 billion, Klarna Bank AB at $14.6 billion**. **CoreWeave is highlighted as a leading candidate with projected revenue of $1.9 billion for 2024—up 700% from 2023**.

**Blue-chip stocks are shares of well-established companies with large market capitalization, long successful track records of generating dependable earnings, and leadership within their industry or sector**. **The best stocks for beginners are often stocks that are household names already, with established businesses and financial strength**.

**Automation vs Manual Curation:**
**Automated systems are great for executing preset strategies with accuracy, offering faster execution in milliseconds compared to seconds to minutes for manual approaches**. **AI stock screeners use machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns, predict market movements and find trades with higher accuracy than traditional methods**.

**Manual approaches allow for on-the-spot adjustments that respond to unexpected market events and rely on human judgment**. **The most effective approach combines automated screening with manual oversight and validation**. **Stock screeners based on genetic algorithms have demonstrated returns up to 28.41% in 1 month**.

**Update Frequency Best Practices:**
**The data is updated daily, with BetterInvesting processes providing new company data to tools the next day after receiving it from Morningstar**. **Curata data shows 48% of marketers are curating at least once a week**. **Best practices recommend batching curation by scheduling time each day, every other day, or once a week**.

**For stock lists, weekly updates provide optimal balance between currency and analytical depth**. **This frequency allows for incorporation of earnings reports, market developments, and sector rotations while avoiding excessive churn**. **Monthly comprehensive reviews should supplement weekly updates to reassess fundamental criteria**.

**Beginner-Friendly Performance Metrics:**
**Best stocks for beginners with little money include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Coca-Cola (KO), Procter & Gamble (PG), and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)**. **For beginner-friendly screening, always look for Sales/Revenue Growth, Gross margins above 40%, EPS Growth 30%, EPS Positive every year in the past 5 years, maximum 1 year negative EPS**.

**Additional criteria include P/FCF below 15, Current Ratio above 1, Revenue growth higher than -2%**. **Companies with growing sales and profits are rewarded by the market, and generally, the faster, the better**.
