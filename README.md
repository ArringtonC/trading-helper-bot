## Trade Table Sorting

The trade table supports sorting by the following fields:

- `symbol`: Sort by ticker symbol
- `type`: Sort by option type (PUT/CALL)
- `strike`: Sort by strike price
- `expiry`: Sort by expiration date
- `quantity`: Sort by position size
- `premium`: Sort by option premium
- `openDate`: Sort by trade open date
- `closeDate`: Sort by trade close date
- `pl`/`pnl`: Sort by profit/loss

Click any column header to sort by that field. Click again to reverse the sort order.

### Sorting Tests

The sorting functionality is thoroughly tested:

1. Unit tests in `src/__tests__/sorting.test.ts`:
   - Basic sorting functionality
   - Edge cases (null values, ties)
   - Performance with large datasets

2. UI tests in `cypress/integration/sorting.spec.ts`:
   - Column header click behavior
   - Sort direction toggle
   - Filtering and grouping interaction
   - Edge cases (empty lists, data updates)

To run sorting tests specifically:

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test sorting

# Run Cypress sorting tests
npm run cypress:open
# Then select sorting.spec.ts
```

## Recent Development Highlights

The conversation documents a comprehensive, iterative development and debugging process for a trading helper bot, focusing on a dynamic rule engine and its integration with a React UI. Here's a detailed summary:

### **1. GoalSizingWizard Enhancements**
- The user enhanced the `GoalSizingWizard.tsx` to support dynamic position sizing rules based on trading objectives (Growth, Drawdown, Income, Capital Objective).
- Added new steps for "Capital Objective" (inputs: `currentBalance`, `targetBalance`, `timeHorizon`, etc.) and trade statistics.
- Implemented sizing solvers (`solveFixedFractionalF`, `calculateKellyFraction`) and displayed solver recommendations.
- Added best-practice suggestions for "Max Position Size" and "Max Total Exposure" based on risk tolerance.
- Developed and debugged component tests using React Testing Library and Jest, resolving issues with test discovery, JSX transformation, and label associations.
- Improved the UI/UX for the summary step, including dollar value calculations and a visually enhanced summary card.
- Updated the PRD with an "Accomplishments" section summarizing these features.

### **2. Taskmaster Workflow**
- The user used Taskmaster to manage tasks, subtasks, and workflow, following a structured process for breaking down, expanding, and updating tasks.
- Moved through tasks related to building a dynamic size-throttle rule engine, including schema design, evaluation logic, and implementation subtasks.

### **3. Rule Engine Development**
- Designed a flexible JSON rule schema and implemented it as a TypeScript interface.
- Built the Action Executor module (`executeAction`) with support for multiple action types and robust error handling, and wrote unit tests for it.
- Developed the Condition Evaluator (`evaluateCondition`) to handle simple and compound conditions, supporting all relevant operators.
- Scaffolded the Rule Engine Core (`evaluateAndExecuteRules`), integrating the condition evaluator and action executor, and added advanced features:
  - Event emitter and structured logging hooks.
  - Scheduling support via `executeAt`.
  - Type safety and extensibility.
- Fixed linter errors and ensured robust type checking throughout.

### **4. UI Integration and Demo**
- Created a new page, `RuleEngineDemo.tsx`, to demonstrate the rule engine in action.
- Connected the demo to real trading data from the OptionsDB page using a global TradesContext.
- Allowed users to select a trade or use manual input, and evaluate rules with computed context (consecutive losses, account balance).
- Added logs and debug statements to trace evaluation and button state.
- Enhanced the demo with:
  - Spinner/progress indicator during evaluation.
  - Disabled inputs during evaluation.
  - Batch evaluation mode with a results table showing which trades triggered rules and what actions were taken.
  - Clear log button and summary of batch results.
  - UI polish for clarity and feedback.

### **5. Testing and Quality**
- Outlined and began implementing a comprehensive, long-term test plan:
  - Unit tests for condition evaluator, action executor, and rule engine core.
  - Integration tests for end-to-end rule evaluation.
  - Performance and regression tests.
  - Test skeletons and initial cases were scaffolded for all major modules.

### **6. Debugging and Issue Resolution**
- Addressed issues with button state, React state updates, and UI interactivity.
- Used console logs and browser dev tools to confirm correct state transitions and DOM updates.
- Ensured the button was re-enabled after evaluation and that the UI responded as expected.

### **7. Next Steps**
- The user confirmed satisfaction with the current state of the rule engine demo and batch evaluation features.
- Moved on to the next subtask: creating comprehensive unit and integration tests for the rule engine, following the best long-term plan for maintainability and coverage.

**Overall, the conversation demonstrates a thorough, best-practice approach to building, testing, and integrating a dynamic rule engine in a trading application, with strong attention to UX, code quality, and maintainability.**
