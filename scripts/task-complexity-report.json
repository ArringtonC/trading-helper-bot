      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Multi-broker CSV Import System",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the CSV import system into subtasks covering UI/UX (drop-zone, preview grid), broker detection logic, fuzzy mapping, validation engine, progress tracking, stream parsing, transactional bulk insert, and comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex UI, robust backend parsing, broker-specific logic, error handling, and high performance requirements. The need for fuzzy mapping, large file support, and transactional integrity further increases complexity. Multiple independent modules and thorough testing are required."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Unified Positions Dashboard",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the dashboard task into subtasks for P&L card design, heat-map visualization, reconciliation logic, diff viewer, dynamic data updates, local database integration, and testing.",
      "reasoning": "The dashboard requires real-time data aggregation, complex visualizations, reconciliation logic, and seamless UI updates. Integrating multiple data sources and ensuring high accuracy adds to the complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Goal-Driven Sizing Wizard",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the wizard into subtasks for modal UI, goal logic implementation, configuration persistence, onboarding flow, and user education/tooltips.",
      "reasoning": "While the wizard involves multi-step UI and configuration logic, the domain is well-scoped and less technically demanding than data integration or real-time systems."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Build Dynamic Size-Throttle Rule Engine",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the rule engine into subtasks for rule schema design, evaluation logic, milestone/throttle rules, rule editor UI, background evaluation process, event/notification system, and persistence/versioning.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires a flexible rule engine, real-time evaluation, user customization, and robust persistence. The interplay between UI, backend logic, and background processing increases complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Strategy Visualizer with Payoff Charts",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the visualizer into subtasks for payoff chart implementation, decay graph, what-if sliders, pricing microservice, responsive design, and performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "Interactive financial visualizations, real-time calculations, and responsive design for complex data make this a challenging task, especially with performance and accuracy requirements."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Live Risk Gauges and Alerts",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the risk gauges task into subtasks for WebSocket integration, gauge visualization, risk threshold logic, in-memory caching, throttling, and alert system.",
      "reasoning": "Real-time data handling, low-latency requirements, and visual feedback mechanisms add significant complexity, though the domain is more focused than full dashboard or import systems."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Create Contextual Tutorial System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the tutorial system into subtasks for tooltip/popover components, CMS integration, Markdown rendering, tutorial sequencing, strategy library, and progress tracking.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating contextual help, content management, and user progress tracking requires coordination between UI, backend, and content systems, but is less algorithmically complex than data processing tasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Community Forum Integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the forum integration into subtasks for feed component, API/proxy integration, leaderboard UI, background metrics job, and authentication/SSO.",
      "reasoning": "While integration and authentication are non-trivial, much of the functionality leverages external services, reducing overall complexity compared to core data or visualization tasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Broker API Synchronization",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down API sync into subtasks for IBKR client, Schwab integration, authentication/credential management, sync service, error/retry logic, alert push service, and fallback mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "Direct broker API integration involves secure authentication, real-time data handling, error resilience, and multi-broker support, making it a technically demanding task."
    },

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Create Mobile Alert Companion PWA",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the PWA into subtasks for PWA architecture, push notification system, mobile UI, localization/internationalization, offline support, and performance testing.",
      "reasoning": "Building a robust, localized PWA with real-time alerts and offline capabilities requires expertise in mobile web, notifications, and internationalization, though the domain is well-understood."
